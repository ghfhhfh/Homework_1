<h1>My name is Dexter</h1>
<b>Dexter Morgan</b>
<p><i> I don't know what made me the way I am.</i></p>
<h2>But whatever it was,<mark> left a hollow place inside.</mark></h2>
<p>People fake a lot of human interactions</p>
<h3>but I feel like I fake them all.</h3>
<h4>And I fake them very well.</h4>
<h5>I really hate that name<i>(Bay Harbour Butcher)</i></h5>
